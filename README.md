VEX Machine Project:

This project was for my Principals of Engineering class in high school. The goal of the project was to create a compound machine from 6 other simple machines using VEX Robtics parts and programming. Moreover, there were certain constraints that had to be satisfied. 

Everything from beginning to end is recorded in the PDF above.
