# Reverse Engineering Project

For my Intro to Engineering Design high school class, I disassembled a Razor Scooter and measured all the parts including screws and bearings. There were a total of 27 parts and they were modeled into Autodesk Inventor. The parts were then assembled and a new innovation I designed was added onto the scooter.

Since the portfolio is more than 80 pages, I included only enough information to convey the purpose of the project.

If you want to know more about specific parts or how I made them, I can do that!
