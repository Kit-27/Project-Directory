Dice Cast Project: 

For my Computer Intergerated Manufacturing class in high school, I had the oppritunity to create a die cast mold for a 8-sided dice. I was given a block of aluminumn and had to create a model that the CNC milling machines could manufacture. Using Autodesk Fusion 360, I made a 8-sided dice that was used to subtract from the model block. However, the block needed to be seperated into two components. After adding some detials to the blocks, I loaded them into a CNC mill and made sure to use the appropiate end mills and speeds for aluminumn.

Melted plastic was then funneled into the cast to create the dice. 

Although the project was mostly sucessful, there were many things that could be improved. For example, you may have noticed that the numbers on the die are actually mirrored! I did not take this into account when making the CAD file. Moreover, the hole at the end of the funnel was to small for the plastic to flow. A sub-optimal non-computer intergrated method (a hand drill) was then used to fix everything except the mirroring. Still, I am proud of this project.
